# Voting systems

## What is this?
A simple website that lets use make elections using 14 different voting systems.Then provides you sick graphs to show the results.

## Why is this?
I was frustrated out how limited quick easy only voting systems were. Also how little preferential voting systems were used. I wanted to make preferential voting systems easy to use and accessible. Then I added Single transferable vote a couple weeks later I have 14 different systems implemented.

## The code is bad
Yeah it is. This isn't meant to be a wow look at how good this rust code is. I use way to many macros but I wanted it done so don't judge me.

## How to use
Fortunately I don't want to open up the whole internet to be able to use this to create elections. 

However I have made these examples and you can view the results
